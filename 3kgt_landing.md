### The Sweet Spot: A '94 VR-4

The 1994 model year is a coveted "sweet spot" for 3000GT enthusiasts. It was the **first year of the second generation**, and it came loaded with everything you could ever want in a high-performance Japanese sports car.

* **Heart of a Beast:** Under the hood lies the legendary twin-turbocharged 3.0L V6 (6G72), now producing a potent **320 horsepower**.
* **Built for Speed:** This was the first year for the much-stronger **Getrag 6-speed manual transmission**, a significant upgrade from the earlier 5-speed.
* **Grip and Glory:** All-wheel drive and all-wheel steering give this car a handling prowess that was ahead of its time.
* **Cutting-Edge Tech:** It retains the iconic **Active Aero** and two-mode exhaust—features that were discontinued in later models. The fixed "sugar scoop" headlights give it a modern, aggressive look that's instantly recognizable.

### The Project: What It Needs, What It Has

This VR-4 is ready for a passionate new owner to give it the care it deserves. It runs and drives, but needs some love to be perfect. The price reflects its current state, making it an incredible value for someone willing to invest some sweat equity.

* **Body:** There's a minor dent and scratch that need attention. A full respray would bring the paint back to a showroom shine, but you could also tackle the localized damage for a more budget-friendly approach.
* **Brakes:** The brake system needs work and it was previously overhauled with new lines and a rebuilt cylinder, and a recent leak was repaired.
* **Clutch:** The clutch cable will need to be replaced, a straightforward job for the motivated DIYer.
* **Engine:** The twin-turbo V6 is solid, a testament to Mitsubishi's engineering.
