## My WFH setup:

### Headsets:
- [Anker Soundcore Q20 ANC Bluetooth Over The Ear Closed Headphones](https://amzn.to/30R1wKV)   
I got these on sale for a long flight and have loved them.

Since I loved the Q20's so much when the Q30's went on sale I had to see how much better the next step up was. They are larger and thus slightly heavier and yet totally worth it. Better noise cancelling and sound isolation. The transparent mode is useful for a quick chat with someone without having to remove the headset. The downside is transparent mode also amplifies some strange noises like the refrigerator or fans. 

### Mics:
- [USB Conference Microphone, CMKTeck Model CM001](https://amzn.to/2PPR2Je)   
During Covid meeting up virtual from games has been a great way to stay in touch and yet multiple devices in the same room in the same Discord channel/Zoom meeting/etc is terrible so now with this conference mic there can be just one mic for the whole room. Has worked out great so far! 
- [Neewer USB Microphone 192KHZ/24BIT Cardioid Condenser Microphone](https://amzn.to/3bLxw9z)   
Wanted to up my game while working from home at my main desk. So got this from an amazon warehouse deal and many people from my work and friends have remarked how nice my audio is while using it.

### Furniture:
- [Mesh Chair](https://www.quill.com/quill-brand-hyken-mesh-task-chair-black-23481-cc/cbs/50026235.html)   
A big step up from the box/old worn out chair I started out on. It's no Aeron chair and yet for the cost which is close to a tenth of an Aeron it's comfortable and adjustable.
- Pros
  - Excellent value
  - Good comfort for hours at a time
  - Well built
- Cons
  - Headrest height is not adjustable
  - Arm rest pads are the short straw for long term comfort

### Streaming:
- Lenovo 500 FHD
- OBS Studio

### Monitors:
- Samsung 27" 4k
- Dell 24" 1080p
- Acer 21" 1080p
