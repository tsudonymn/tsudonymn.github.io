[Mitsubishi_3000GT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_3000GT)

In 1994, Mitsubishi produced approximately 4,163 units of the 3000GT VR-4 for the U.S. market. That year marked a key transition for the model, introducing the second-generation facelift with updated styling, projector headlights, and a slightly revised interior.
Here’s a quick snapshot of what made the ’94 VR-4 special:
- 🌀 Twin-turbocharged 3.0L V6 (6G72) with 320 hp
- ⚙️ 6-speed Getrag manual transmission (first year for the 6-speed)
- 🛞 All-wheel drive & all-wheel steering
- 🪶 Active aerodynamics and electronically controlled suspension

The Significance of the '94 VR-4
First, let's understand why the '94 is a special year. It's the first year of the second generation, which brought significant updates:

- *New Look*: Ditched the pop-up headlights for fixed projector-beam "sugar scoop" headlights.
- *More Power*: Horsepower was bumped from 300 to 320 hp.
- *Upgraded Transmission*: The 5-speed manual was replaced with a much stronger Getrag 6-speed manual.
- *It still has the good stuff*: The '94 model retains the coveted Active Aero (front air dam and rear spoiler that adjust with speed) and the two-mode exhaust, features that were removed in later years.
Because of this, the '94-'96 models are often considered a "sweet spot" for many enthusiasts.
