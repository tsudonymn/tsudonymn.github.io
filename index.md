#### Slightly longer version
After a typically overwhelming experience in game development. I sought out ways to make developing software better. I was lucky to join a group of folks that had been associated with the Chrysler C3 project and were on a similar path. They leveraged Extreme Programming and in working with them I found my niche. Since then I've applied philosophies from XP, Agile, Lean, and other methodologies to help teams develop better software for many domains including DNA matching, automotive, social science data collection, publishing, and financial sector messaging platforms. I'm currently providing value with teams by helping people be more awesome while building valuable software.
